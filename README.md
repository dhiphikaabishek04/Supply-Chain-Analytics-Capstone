# Supply Chain Analytics Capstone

This repository contains three end-to-end analytics and AI projects focused on logistics and warehouse operations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Shipment Delay Prediction
- Predicts delayed vs on-time shipments using historical logistics data
- Identifies key operational drivers of delays
- Supports proactive decision-making in supply chain operations

### 2. Shipment Risk Detection (Anomaly Detection)
- Uses unsupervised learning to identify high-risk shipments
- Detects abnormal patterns without relying on labeled delay data

### 3. Warehouse Shelf Condition Detection using CNN
- Uses computer vision to classify warehouse shelf conditions
- Detects damaged, overloaded, empty, misplaced, and normal shelves
- Improves warehouse safety and operational efficiency
